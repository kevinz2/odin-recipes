<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This 3-ingredient egg fried rice has been my favorite snack since the time I was growing up. Yep, for me, the ideal afternoon or late night snack is a plate of fried rice. Not chips or cookies. I love it for breakfast as well. This fried rice is a life-saver because it’s so fast to make. It only uses three ingredients: leftover rice, eggs, and green onions, which I always have in the fridge. Whenever I’m craving some salty food, I rush to the kitchen to whip up this dish in five minutes.</p>
<p>I have quite a few fried rice recipes that I love, for example, Yang Zhou Fried Rice, XO Fried Rice with Char Siu, and Chicken Fried Rice. But my go-to side dish is still this egg fried rice. It does not require any complicated seasoning or any special meat or vegetables. It’s so simple yet comforting and satisfying. </p>
